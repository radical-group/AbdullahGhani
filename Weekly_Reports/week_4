**2/28**

**What I have been working on:**

Setting up radical pilot on Amarel with Andre and Mikhail via issues. Done and putting up final config file soon on github. 

Working with Greg and George towards testing and profiling of FACTs. Still ongoing.  Some of the input data used for the IPCC projections cannot be used for this paper, so waiting for Greg to investigate generating some of those input fields, and will go from there when he is ready.
