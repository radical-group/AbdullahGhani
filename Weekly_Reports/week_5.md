**3/6**

**What I have been working on:**

Met with Travis along with Professor Jha and Matteo to discuss first steps towards SAMPLE toolkit. Travis will be sending resources including a relevant MATLAB toolkit, data sets etc for me to play around with and understand how we can effectively use these data sets to identify regions of higher uncertainty and and direct data garnering to those locations.

Had FACTS group meeting. Greg is making progress with generating data points working with certain modules. Next steps are running the profiler and tests and workflows enabled so we can start profiling which we will initiate in the next technical meeting
