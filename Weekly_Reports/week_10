**4/17**

**What I have been working on:**


Working with Andre on workflow-1 for covid19 project. https://github.com/2019-ncovgroup/DrugWorkflows/tree/devel/workflow-1

Going through resources here: https://github.com/aclyde11/Model-generation/blob/covid/workflow_dock_system.py

Facts was able to successfully run on Amarel with the config file I composed. Working with Greg to draft documentation for other users to use for their runs. https://github.com/radical-collaboration/facts

Moving RCT documentation away from read the docs. Looking at suitable alternatives.
