**4/24**

**What I have been working on:**


Working with Andre on workflow-1 for covid19 project. Going through resources here

Facts was able to successfully run on Amarel with the config file I composed. Working with Greg to draft documentation for other users to use for their runs. 

Certain FACTs workflows require allocation of system memory (RAM) as the localization process can eat up a lot of memory. Working with Hyungro to get this supported on RP.
