**2/7/20**

**What I have been working on:**

Reading up heavily on the documentation for RCT provided at the github repos, the respective webpages, and the PDF documents that professor Jha provided to familiarise myself with the architecture and functionalities of the software.

Running examples from Radical Pilot and EnTK on my local machine and the Radical VM-2 

Got access to the XSEDE cluster resources and playing around with launching workloads on said target machines to gauge my understanding of pilot and ensemble based workflows.

Attending FACTs meeting with Greg, Matteo and George to help my understanding of that project and whether my skill set can be of any assistance.

**Goals for next week:**

Meet/get in touch with Rebecca and Travis to get relevant reading material and gauge a better understanding of the SAMPL project

Play around further with the Jetstream environment and launch my own Ensemble workflows on Xsede allocations

Help out further with the Facts project; working with George to establish/define unit tests as discussed in the meeting
