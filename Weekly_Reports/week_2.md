**2/14**

**What I have been working on:**

Setup gsissh access to my XSEDE resources from jetstream VM with the help of Matteo

Reviewed the revamped documentation of Pilot, running all the examples to make sure they worked accordingly on my local machine and XSEDE resources. Had some problems with ‘wait for pilots’ timing out but that was solved by the version update (thank you Andre). 

Another problem with the Pilot jobs was that it was failing to allocate more than one node on Stampede: https://use.jetstream-cloud.org/application/projects/7274/instances/37112 From my experiments worked adequately on other machines.

Meeting with Rebecca and Travis got delayed. Aim to meet with them the week of 25th.
