**What I have been working on:**


Running scaling experiments on Frontera in terms of 3 parameters: size of buffer, number of workers, number of cores.

Running benchmark tests on WF1 to also see how the size of the channel affects the throughput.

Working with George and Hyungro to solve issue #24 for EnTK. https://github.com/radical-collaboration/facts/issues/24
